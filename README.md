# Basic CORS Server

## Description

This is a simple application that demonstrates the use of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). It consists of a client and a server. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds to the request.

## Features

- Client-server communication using CORS
- Visual feedback in the client when the server responds

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm install` to install the client dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install` to install the server dependencies.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required.

## Usage

To start the server, navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm start`.

To start the client, navigate to the `client` directory and run `npm start`.

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the client.

## Examples

Click the "Ping Backend" button in the client to send a request to the server. The server will respond and the client will display the response.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)" error, make sure that the server is running and that the client is correctly configured to send requests to the server's URL.
